# 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander

I'm a developer, builder, and systems thinker passionate about **every layer of the tech stack** — from the lowest bits of firmware to cloud-based backend services.

---

## 🧠 About Me

I thrive on bridging hardware and software, and I've spent the last few years building everything from **custom motor controllers** to **concurrent collaborative platforms**.

Whether it's:

- Writing **firmware** for high-speed **electric skateboards** and **balancing boards**
- Tuning my own **custom ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers)**
- Working on **operating systems** in university courses or in my own projects
- Designing scalable, **real-time backends** for **multi-user editors** using **Kafka**
- Or just debugging low-level issues for fun...

…what excites me most is **understanding how the entire stack works** and **building systems that matter**.

## 🧰 What I’ve Worked On

### ⚙️ Embedded & Firmware
- Designed firmware for **DIY electric skateboards** and **hoverboards**
- Built **safety-critical motor control systems**
- Worked directly with **sensors, communication buses, and RTOS**

### 🧾 Operating Systems
- Wrote kernel modules and memory managers as part of my OS coursework
- Explored syscall routing, context switching, and scheduler design

### 🖥️ Custom Hardware
- Developed a **custom ESC** from scratch, tuned for smooth braking and regenerative charging
- Designed and debugged low-level drivers and real-time control loops

### 🛰️ Backend Systems
- Built **concurrent editing tools** with Kafka, WebSockets, and dynamic scaling
- Designed **multi-user collaborative infrastructure** that scales and syncs seamlessly
- Used **Kubernetes & Minikube** for local cloud emulation and deployment

## 🚀 Current Focus

Right now, I’m deep into building **real-time collaborative platforms**, exploring distributed state consistency, and making infrastructure that’s **fast, fault-tolerant, and easy to deploy**.
